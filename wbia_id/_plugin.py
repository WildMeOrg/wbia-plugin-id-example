# WBIA Controller and Python API
# -------------------------------
#
# WBIA supports dynamically-injected methods to the controller object.  Any
# function that you wrap with the @register_ibs_method decorator is automatically
# added to the controller as ibs.<function_name>() method.  The function then becomes
# accessible anywhere in the codebase if one has access to the WBIA controller.
# For example,
#
#     @register_ibs_method
#     def new_plugin_function(ibs, parameter1, *args, **kwargs):
#         return '%s in %s' (parameter1, ibs.dbname, )
#
# will be accessible at ibs.new_plugin_function('test') and will return the value
# 'test for testdb_identification' when executed if the database's containing
# folder is named "testdb_identification".
#
# Database Structure
# ------------------
# An WBIA database, at it's core, is simply a folder on the local file system.
# WBIA uses SQLite3 and static folders for all of its database and asset storage
# and has the following structure:
#
#     wbia_database_folder/
#         _ibsdb/
#             _wbia_backups/
#             _wbia_cache/
#             _wbia_logs/
#             images/
#             _wbia_database.sqlite3
#             _wbia_staging.sqlite3
#             <other miscellaneous folders and files>
#         smart_patrol/
#         <other miscellaneous folders and files>
#
# The volatile (i.e. cannot be re-computed) database files and folders are:
#
#     _wbia_database.sqlite3
#         The primary WBIA database.  This database contains many tables to store
#         image, annotation, name, asset properties and store various decisions and
#         computed results.
#
#     _wbia_staging.sqlite3
#         A staging database for semi-temporary results, content in this database is
#         intended to eventually be committed or resolved into the primary database
#
#     images/
#         A folder containing all of the localized images for the datbase.  Images
#         are renamed when copied to this folder to be <UUID>.<EXT>.  The image's
#         UUID is computed deterministically based on the pixel content of the image
#         and we inherit any original file extensions to prevent loosing any metadata.
#
# We also have extensive caching processes for different computer vision and machine
# learning results along with modified versions of the original assets.  All cached
# data is stored in the _ibsdb/_wbia_cache/ folder.  This folder can be deleted
# freely at any point to delete any pre-computed results.  Conversely, we also take
# daily snapshots of the primary and staging database whenever the WBIA controller
# is first started.  These backups are stored in _ibsdb/_wbia_backups/.  The WBIA
# controller also supports incremental updates, so a database backup is also
# performed before any database update.
#
# We provide an example below on how to write a customized database controller
# along with example incremental update functions.
#
# First-order Data Objects
# ------------------------
# There are 4 main data constructs in WBIA:
#
#     ImageSets   - A collection of images into a single group.  This grouping is
#                   used as a very general association and can indicate, for example,
#                   the set of images taken at the same time and place or the images
#                   that all contain a target species or the images that are to
#                   be used by a machine learning algorithm for training or testing.
#     Images      - Original images provided by the user or contributor.
#                   ImageSets and Images have a many-to-many relationship as
#                   more than one image can be in an ImageSet and an image can be
#                   a member of multiple ImageSets.
#     Annotations - Pixel regions within an Image to designate a single animal.
#                   Annotations are, in their most basic form, a bounding box.
#                   Bounding boxes in WBIA are parameterized by (xtl, ytl, w, h)
#                   where "xtl" designates "x pixel coordinate for the top-left corner",
#                   "ytl" designates "y pixel coordinate for the top-left corner",
#                   "w" designates "the width of the box in pixel coordinates", and
#                   "h" designates "the height of the box in pixel coordinates".
#                   Images and Annotations have a one-to-many relationship.
#     Names       - A ID label for an annotation.  A one-to-many relationship
#                   between Names and Annotations is usually the end-result of
#                   using the WBIA system.
#
# In general, a single instance of the WBIA code base only has one WBIA controller
# (commonly referred to by the variable name "ibs") and is the primary development
# handle for any new features.  The controller is packed with very handy functions,
# including:
#
#     gid_list = ibs.get_valid_gids()  # returns the internal rowids for images
#     aid_list = ibs.get_valid_aids()  # returns the internal rowids for annotations
#     nid_list = ibs.get_valid_nids()  # returns the internal rowids for names
#
# These lists of internal rowids allow for a wide range of adders, getters, setters,
# deleters and algorithm calls.  For example,
#
#     image_gps_list  = ibs.get_image_gps(gid_list)    # Returns a parallel list of image 2-tuple (lat, lon) GPS coordinates
# or
#     annot_uuid_list = ibs.get_annot_uuids(aid_list)  # Returns a parallel list of annotation UUIDs
# or
#     aids_list       = ibs.get_name_aids(nid_list)    # Returns a parallel list of lists of aids
#
# In general, if you think a function should exist to associate two object types
# or compute some value, it probably already exists.
#
# Controller API Injection
# ------------------------
# Any function that is decorated by @register_ibs_method should accept the WBIA
# "ibs" controller object as the first parameter.
#
# IMPORTANT: To be enabled, a plug-in must be manually registered with the WBIA
# controller.  The registration process involves adding the module import name for
# this _plugin.py file to a list of plugins.  This list lives in the main WBIA
# repository at:
#
#     wbia/wbia/control/WBIAControl.py
#
# and added to the list with variable name "AUTOLOAD_PLUGIN_MODNAMES" at the top
# of the file.  On load, the WBIA controller will add its own injected controller
# functions and will then proceed to add any external plug-in functions.  The
# injection code will look primarily for any functions with the @register_ibs_method
# decorator, but will also add any of the decorators described below for web
# requests.
_, register_ibs_method = controller_inject.make_ibs_register_decorator(__name__)


# WBIA REST API, Web Interface, and Job Engine
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# WBIA supports a web-based REST API that allows for local functions to be called
# from public end-points.  The POST and GET arguments that are passed to the
# web server by the client are automatically parsed into Python-valid objects
# using a customized JSON converter.  Any responses from API calls are also wrapped
# by a JSON encoding and thus also need to be serialize-able.
#
# Any function that you with to expose to the web simply needs a @register_api
# decorator added above the function's definition (after any @register_ibs_method)
# decorators.  This decorator takes in the endpoint and the allowed HTTP method(s)
# (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that are allowed.  The same REST endpoint can point
# to different functions through the specifications of different methods.
#
# WBIA REST API
# --------------
# There already exists an extensive REST API that mirrors the existing Python
# API, but is a curated subset of useful functions.  For example, the Python API
# function
#
#     gps_list = ibs.get_image_gps(gid_list=[1,2,3] )
#
# has a mirrored REST API interface at the endpoint
#
#     [GET] /api/image/gps/?gid_list=[1,2,3]
#
# and returns a JSON-formatted response with the same contents for gps_list.
#
# Alternatively, a user can opt to expose an endpoint that does not apply any
# JSON response serialization.  Specific examples of this need include wanting to
# serve HTML pages, raw image bytes, CSV or XML downloads, redirects or HTTP errors
# or any other non-JSON response.  Functions that are decorated with @register_route
# also benefit from the same parameter JSON serialization as @register_api.
#
# WBIA Web Interface
# -------------------
# WBIA also supports a basic web interface with viewing tools and curation tools.
# For example, the routes /view/imagesets/, /view/images/, /view/annotations/,
# and /view/parts/ allow for a user to quickly see the state of the database.
# There is also a batched uploading function to easily add a handful of images to
# a database without needing to use the full Python or REST APIs for larger imports.
#
# The web-tools for turking (borrowing the phrase from "Amazon Mechanical Turk")
# support a wide range of helpful functions.  The most helpful interface is
# arguably the annotation bounding box and metadata interface.  This interface
# can be viewed at /turk/detection/?gid=X and shows the current annotations for
# Image RowID=X, where they are located, what metadata is set on them, what parts
# (if any) have been added to the annotations, and what metadata is on the parts.
#
# While not required, we STRONGLY suggest all API endpoints in a plug-in to be
# prefixed with "/api/plugin/<Plug-in Name>/.../.../" to keep the registered APIs from
# conflicting.  We also suggest doing the same with your function names as well
# that are injected into the WBIA controller on load, for example using a
# function name of ibs.wbia_plugin_<Plug-in Name>_..._...().
#
# Background API Job Engine
# -------------------------
# The REST API has a background "job engine".  The purpose of the job engine
# is to preserve the special properties of a responsive and state-less web
# paradigm.  In short, the WBIA web controller will automatically serialized
# concurrent requests but some API calls involve a very long processing delay.
# If a long API call is called in the main thread, it will deny any and all
# simultaneous web calls from resolving.  The solution is to mode any long API
# calls that are exposed by the web interface to the job engine to promote
# responsiveness and reduce or eliminate client-side web time outs.  Any API that
# uses the job engine (as shown in an example below) should return a job UUID
# and should be prefixed with "/api/engine/plugin/<Plug-in Name>/.../.../" to
# differentiate it from an instantaneous call.  We also recommend having any
# engine calls accept the POST HTTP method by default.
#
# A user or application can query on the status of a background job, get its
# original request metadata, and retrieve any results.  The job engine supports
# automatic callbacks with a specified URL and HTTP method when the job is
# complete.
register_api = controller_inject.get_wbia_flask_api(__name__)
register_route = controller_inject.get_wbia_flask_route(__name__)


# WBIA Dependency Graph
# ----------------------
#
# WBIA supports a dependency-graph cache computation structure for easy pipelining.
# This is similar to other frameworks (e.g. Luigi) but has been customized and
# implemented by hand to resolve assets consistent with the WBIA database.
#
# In general, a dependency cache (referred to by "depc" in the code base) is a
# coding tool to eliminate the complexity of managing state and staged pipeline
# configurations.  For example, say we want to compute the sum and product of a
# cryptographically secure hash of an image's pixel data.  We may want to build
# a dependency graph that looks like this
#
#                               +-----------+
#                               |           |
#                               |   Images  |
#                               |           |
#                               +-----+-----+
#                                     |
#                   +-----------------+-----------------+
#                   |                 |                 |
#             +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+
#             |           |     |           |     |           |
#             |  Feature  |     |    Hash   |     | Thumbnail |
#             |           |     |           |     |           |
#             +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+
#                                     |
#                                     +-----------------+
#                                     |                 |
#                               +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+
#                               |           |     |           |
#                               |  HashSum  |     |  HashProd |
#                               |           |     |           |
#                               +-----------+     +-----------+
#
# To compute the HashSum on an Image, we first need to compute a Hash on the
# Image.  The dependency cache will preserve this ordering by computing and
# storing intermediate results for use by the depc node you want to retrieve.
# Therefore, e would expect that any call to HashSum for Image RowID=10 would
# also compute the Hash for Image RowID=10.  Subsequently calling the call for
# HashProd on Image RowID=10 (with the same configuration) will simply retrieve
# the pre-computed Hash for RowID=10.
#
# The WBIA dependency cache infrastructure designates three ROOT object types
# for this type of computation: Images, Annotations, and Parts.  There exists
# three parallel decorators that allow one to make a new function for the
# appropriate dependency graph tree.  Adding a new node to the graph requires
# writing a function with the correct inputs and a specific configured decorator.
# We provide a working example below on how to write the decorator for Hash and
# HashSum.
#
# We provide an example below on how to create your own custom depc and
# decorator function
register_preproc_image = controller_inject.register_preprocs['image']

# register_preproc_part  = controller_inject.register_preprocs['part']


# WBIA Code Structure, Documentation, Tests, Linting, and Profiling
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The WBIA code based is actually a collection of 17 high-level repositories:
#
#     Core WBIA repositories
#         wbia
#         wbia_cnn  (deprecated soon)
#
#     Core Utility repositories (in order of most use)
#         utool
#         ubelt
#         dtool
#         vtool
#         plottool
#         guitool
#         detecttools
#
#     Core Detection repositories (in order of most use)
#         lightnet
#         brambox
#         pydarknet
#         pyrf
#
#     Core Identification repositories
#         flann
#         hesaff
#
#     First-party Plug-in repositories
#         wbia-curvrank-module
#         wbia-flukematch-module
#
# It is important to have all of these repositories installed and configured with
# Python's package manager.  If otherwise specified, the development branch for
# all of these repositories is "next".
#
# Code Documentation
# ------------------
# The WBIA documentation style uses a modified version of Sphinx "doctests" for
# all documentation and testing.  The ability to write good documentation directly
# in the header of the function is of high value by any contributor to the WBIA
# code base and any plug-in maintainer.  We provide examples of how to correctly
# document your code throughout this _plugin.py file.
#
# To build the documentation, run the script "build_documentation.sh" in the top-
# level folder of this repository.  The built documentation will be rendered into
# a web HTML format in the folder _page/.  The documentation can be searched and
# navigated by loading _page/index.html.
#
# Code Tests
# ----------
# The immediate benefit of this structure  is that documentation can live alongside
# parameter specifications, REST API endpoints, and unit testing code block(s).
# To run a given test code block, one must simply tell python to execute
# the module and pass in the function name and the test index.  For example, if
# you want to run the first code test for the function
# ibs.wbia_plugin_id_hello_world() in this file, you can call
#
#     python -m wbia_id._plugin --test-wbia_plugin_id_hello_world:0
#
# Note the ":0" index specifier at the end of this Command Line call.  To run all
# of the tests for a specified function, you must remove any post-fix.  For example,
#
#     python -m wbia_id._plugin --test-wbia_plugin_id_hello_world
#
# will run all of the tests for that function.  To run all tests for an entire file,
# you can simply call:
#
#     python -m wbia_id._plugin --allexamples
#
# We also provide a handy script at the top level path for this repository called
# "run_tests.py" that will execute all of the tests for all files.  A summary
# report "timeings.txt" and "failed_doctests.txt" will be created for each run.
#
# When run in bulk, you may with to disable a specific test from the set of all
# tests you end up writing.  You may do this to improve the speed of the batch
# test call or to exclude tests that are currently a work-in-progress or are
# intended for storing notes and helpful code snippets.  You can add the first-line
# macro "ENABLE_DOCTEST" or "DISABLE_DOCTEST" to enable or disable the test.
#
# Python Code Linting (Flake8)
# ----------------------------
# All WBIA Python code requires a Linter to be run on any code contributions
# for the main code base.  While we do not explicitly require this for WBIA
# plug-ins, we STRONGLY suggest using one for all Python code.  We do acknowledge,
# however, that the full Python Flake8 (http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
# specification is quire restrictive.  We have a set of allowed errors and warnings
# to ignore, below:
#
#     "D100", "D101", "D102", "D103", "D105", "D200", "D205", "D210", "D400",
#     "D401", "D403", "E127", "E201", "E202", "E203", "E221", "E222", "E241",
#     "E265", "E271", "E272", "E301", "E501", "N802", "N803", "N805", "N806",
#
# Writing good Python code is subjective but a linter will help to make all
# Python contributors follow a consistent set of cleanliness standards.
#
# Python Code Profiling (ut.inject2)
# ----------------------------------
# On top of a large suite of tools, utool (referred to as "ut") also offers
# profiling functions for code segments.  To see this in action, run any Python
# CLI command (e.g. a test) with the extra CLI parameter "--profile" at the end.
# Any function that has the @profile decorator on the function will be profiled
# for run-time efficiency.  For example, running from the CLI:
#
#     python -m wbia_id._plugin --test-wbia_plugin_id_file_download:1 --profile
#
# Will run the test of downloading an image from a remote server, check a local
# copy, delete it, then re-download the image.  The output of this call will look
# something like this:
#
#     **[TEST.FINISH] wbia_plugin_id_file_download -- SUCCESS

#
# This output tells us that we spent 0.1369 seconds and 99.9% of our total run-time
# in this function downloading the file on line 587.  This output is very helpful
# for any developer wishing to optimize the run-time performance of their code.


# Other miscellaneous notes
# -------------------------
#
# Note 1: The WBIA code base has a constants file for a lot of convenient
# conversions and names of constructs.  This constants module also keeps track of
# very convenient environment variables:
#
#     wbia.constants.CONTAINERIZED  (Set to True if running inside a Docker container)
#     wbia.constants.PRODUCTION     (Set to True if running in production mode)
#
# When PRODUCTION is set to True, please observe a restraint in resource utilization
# for system memory, number of concurrent threads, and GPU memory.
#
# Note 2: We suggest to use interactive embedding with utool.embed() whenever
# and whenever possible.  The use of ut.embed() (we commonly import "utool" with
# the shorthand namespace of "ut") is used throughout the WBIA code base and is
# supremely helpful when debugging troublesome code.  We have set an example below
# that uses ut.embed() in the ibs.wbia_plugin_id_hello_world()
# documentation.  We highly recommend calling this function's example test and

    A toy example of creating a crypto-graphically secure (salted) hash of an on-disk image.

    The SQLite3 database location for this dependency cache table is located in
    the loaded WBIA database folder.  A new table is made automatically named
    "IdentificationExampleImageHash" in the file
    "_ibsdb/_wbia_cacahe/identification_example.sqlite", as defined by the
    "tablename" and fname" parameters in the above decorator's configuration.

    The colnames and coltypes parameters specify the desired columns that are to be
    created by the dependency cache.  In practice, we serialize all of these results
    and support customized read/write serialization for external assets.  To use a
    custom external reader or writer, specify the coltype for the appropriate
    column as ('extern', load_func, save_func).  For example, if you want to
    store a Numpy array in its full format, you can specify a coltype of
    ('extern', np.load, np.save) or an image with ('extern', cv2.imread, cv2.imwrite)
    or a cPickle through some fancy Utool magic with
    ('extern', ut.partial(ut.load_cPkl, verbose=False), ut.partial(ut.save_cPkl, verbose=False)).
    The depc controller will automatically create a new file on disk and delete
    any external assets when a cached result is invalidated.  The reader function
    must take in an absolute filepath and return the data and the writer must
    take in the data to save and the absolute filepath destination.

    The configclass parameter must be a dt.Config object, as shown above.  The
    _param_info_list attribute of this class defines a list of parameters for this
    depc node.  Thesse parameter names must be unique across the entire dependency
    graph.  Only the relevant parameters in an entire pipeline configuration will
    be passed to this function in the config dictionary variable.

    The chunksize parameter specifies the maximum number of Image IDs (gids)
    that are passed into gid_list.  If a list of gids larger than the chunksize
    is given to the dependency cache, the depc controller will automatically
    batch them into chunks of size chinksize.  You will not get an empty list.

    This function is called automatically by the IdentificationExampleOracleRequest
    whenever the appropriate ID algorithm 'IdentificationExampleOracle' is specified
    as the 'pipeline_root'.  No matter the respective size of the original qaid_list
    (Query Annotation RowIDs) and daid_list (Database Annotation RowIDs), this
    function will always be given parallel lists.  The lists are defined as the
    total number of combinations between the query and database annotations, which
    obviously may be very large for big ID queries.

    We thus highly suggest using batch processing and as many database loads as
    possible.  To achieve the original qaid_list and daid_list, simply do the
    following:

    ```
        original_qaid_list = list(set(qaid_list))
        original_daid_list = list(set(daid_list))
    ```

    However, the results are required to be passed in for the appropriate order
    as defined by the qaid_list and daid_list passed to this function.  If your
    call would benefit greatly from creating a single global cache or model for
    this ID call, we strongly suggest making the chunksize=None so that your
    plug-in code can know about the entire ID graph.  Any functions within here
    could rely on batched processing, but there is a benefit to the plug-in knowing
    the context and scale of the ID job it has been asked to complete.

    Our example here will always produce a ID match score of 1.0 for correct matches
    (based on the ground-truth name in the database for each annotation) and 0.0
    for any annotation pair that is of different individuals.  There is a
    configurable 'oracle_fallibility' parameter, which makes a randomized
    determination for each pair to flip this correct decision and make an error.

    From web, this function is called by Wildbook as
        - REST POST to /api/engine/query/graph/
            - Configured pipeline_root specifies algorithm
        - Resoles to Python function start_identify_annots_query
